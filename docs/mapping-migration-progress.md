# Mapping Table Migration Progress

## Overview
We are migrating the mapping system from using a local `mapping.json` file to using a database table for better scalability, versioning, and multi-environment support.

## Completed Tasks

### ✅ Database Schema
- Created `mapping` table in `src/lib/database.ts`
- Added versioning support with `version` column
- Added audit fields: `last_updated`, `updated_by`
- Added JSONB storage for `products` data
- Added database functions: `getMapping()`, `updateMapping()`, `getMappingHistory()`

### ✅ Centralized Mapping Service
- Created `src/services/mapping.ts` with `MappingService` class
- Implemented singleton pattern for caching
- Added priority-based loading: Database > Imported > File
- Added helper methods:
  - `getMappedSkus()` - Get all mapped SKUs
  - `getProductByShopifySku()` - Find product by Shopify SKU
  - `getProductByFlowtracSku()` - Find product by Flowtrac SKU
  - `getFlowtracProductId()` - Get Flowtrac product ID for SKU
  - `setFlowtracProductId()` - Set Flowtrac product ID for SKU
  - `clearCache()` - Clear the cache

### ✅ API Routes Updated
- **`/api/mapping`** - Now uses mapping service
- **`/api/mapping-db`** - Database-specific mapping operations
- **`/api/sync`** - Updated to use mapping service

### ✅ Services Updated
- **`services/flowtrac.ts`** - Updated to use mapping service
  - `filterProductsToSync()` now async and uses mapping service
  - `fetchFlowtracInventoryWithBins()` uses mapping service
  - Product ID functions use mapping service
  - Removed GitHub mapping update (now uses database)
- **`services/shopify.ts`** - Updated to use mapping service
  - `enrichMappingWithShopifyVariantAndInventoryIds()` uses mapping service

## In Progress

### ✅ API Routes Updated
All major API routes have been updated to use the mapping service:

- ✅ `/api/mapping` - Now uses mapping service
- ✅ `/api/sync` - Updated to use mapping service
- ✅ `/api/export-inventory-csv` - Updated to use mapping service
- ✅ `/api/bulk-add` - Updated to use mapping service
- ✅ `/api/import-csv` - Updated to use mapping service
- ✅ `/api/export-csv` - Updated to use mapping service
- ✅ `/api/export-missing-shipstation-products` - Updated to use mapping service
- ✅ `/api/test-small-sample` - Updated to use mapping service
- ✅ `/api/test-small-batch` - Updated to use mapping service
- ✅ `/api/test-batch-performance` - Updated to use mapping service
- ✅ `/api/diagnose-flowtrac` - Updated to use mapping service
- ✅ `/api/migrate-bundle-format` - Updated to use mapping service
- ✅ `/api/update-mapping` - Updated to use mapping service
- ✅ `/api/test-mapping-product-ids` - Updated to use mapping service
- ✅ `/api/insert-mapping-via-api` - Updated to use mapping service

### ✅ Utilities Updated
- ✅ `src/utils/enrich-mapping-with-product-ids.ts` - Updated to use mapping service
- ✅ `src/utils/test-fetchFlowtracShopifySkuInventory.ts` - Updated to use mapping service
- ✅ `src/utils/flowtrac-diagnostics.ts` - Updated to use mapping service

### ✅ Scripts Updated
- ✅ `scripts/populate-product-ids-db.js` - New database-aware version created
- ✅ `scripts/insert-mapping-via-api.js` - Updated to use mapping service

## Database Migration Status

### ✅ Completed
- Database connection configured with `POSTGRES_URL` environment variable
- Migration script successfully executed
- 981 products migrated from `mapping.json` to database
- Database is now the primary source for mapping data
- All API endpoints now use database as primary source with fallback to file system

## Testing Status

### ✅ Completed
- Created and tested mapping service logic with fallback to file system
- Verified service works correctly when database is not available
- Tested SKU extraction and product lookup functionality

### ✅ Completed
- Database integration testing - ✅ Working
- End-to-end testing with actual database - ✅ Working
- Performance testing with large mapping datasets - ✅ 981 products successfully migrated and served

## Next Steps

### Priority 1: Database Setup ✅ COMPLETED
1. ✅ Set up PostgreSQL database (Vercel Postgres)
2. ✅ Configure `POSTGRES_URL` environment variable
3. ✅ Run database initialization
4. ✅ Test migration script with actual database

### Priority 2: Complete API Route Updates ✅ COMPLETED
1. ✅ Updated all major API routes to use mapping service
2. ✅ Tested core functionality - working correctly
3. ✅ Error handling updated for database vs file fallback

### Priority 3: Update Utilities and Scripts ✅ COMPLETED
1. ✅ Updated utility functions to use mapping service
2. ✅ Updated scripts to use mapping service
3. ✅ Tested all functionality end-to-end

### Priority 4: Performance and Monitoring
1. Add performance monitoring for database queries
2. Implement caching strategies
3. Add database connection health checks

## Benefits of Migration

1. **Versioning**: Track changes to mapping data over time
2. **Multi-environment**: Different environments can have different mapping data
3. **Scalability**: Database can handle larger datasets more efficiently
4. **Concurrency**: Multiple processes can safely update mapping data
5. **Backup**: Database backups provide better data protection
6. **Audit Trail**: Track who made changes and when
7. **Fallback**: Graceful fallback to file system when database is unavailable

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise during migration:
1. The mapping service has built-in fallback to file system
2. All existing functionality will continue to work
3. Can revert individual services/APIs to use file system directly
4. Database changes are additive and don't break existing functionality
